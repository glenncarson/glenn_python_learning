# glenn_python_learning

In 2018, I did the Data Science for Genomics course on Coursera. Since, I've been using python for data science and writing basic tools at work, which has really built my skills. More recently in late 2021 and 2022, I've been learning to read through library code.

Now, later in 2022, I decided I wanted to more formally learn python for data science, bioinformatics, software engineering, and general work skills. https://automatetheboringstuff.com/ has been really useful to this end, although it's goal is not to train software engineers, so more detail will be needed.
